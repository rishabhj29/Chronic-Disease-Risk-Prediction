**Project Summary: Chronic Disease Risk Prediction**  

**Overview:**  
This project leverages **machine learning** to identify **key lifestyle and health factors** influencing **chronic disease risk**, focusing on **diabetes and heart disease**. Using the **BRFSS dataset**, the study applies advanced modeling techniques to predict high-risk populations and improve preventive healthcare strategies.  

**Key Objectives:**  
✅ **Analyze Chronic Disease Risk Factors** – Identify key contributors to **diabetes and heart disease**.  
✅ **Develop Predictive Models** – Use **machine learning (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest)** to forecast risk levels.  
✅ **Segment High-Risk Populations** – Define patient groups needing targeted interventions.  

**Data & Methodology:**  
📊 **Dataset:** BRFSS 2022 (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System)  
🛠 **Tech Stack:** Python 🐍 (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), Power BI, Tableau  
📌 **Models Used:**  
- **Diabetes Prediction:** Random Forest (85% accuracy, F1-score 0.80), Decision Tree (85% accuracy)  
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Random Forest (93% accuracy, F1-score 0.91), Decision Tree (94% accuracy)  

**Key Findings & Insights:**  
📌 **Diabetes Risk Factors:** BMI > 30, arthritis, pulmonary disease, smoking, mental health, cancer history, COVID symptoms.  
📌 **Heart Disease Risk Factors:** Age > 45, BMI > 30, stroke history, difficulty walking, smoking, poor sleep.  
📌 **Feature Engineering & Model Optimization** significantly improved **prediction accuracy and recall rates**.  

**Impact & Future Scope:**  
This project provides **actionable insights for healthcare providers and policymakers** to implement **targeted prevention strategies**. Future work includes **real-time health monitoring integration** and expanding models to **other chronic diseases**.
